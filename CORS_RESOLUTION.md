# CORS Issue Resolution for BLS Visualizations

## Problem Statement
Local testing of the HTML treemap visualizations previously produced CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when the pages were opened directly from the filesystem. The JavaScript attempted to load CSV data using `XMLHttpRequest`, which browsers block for `file://` URLs.

## Solution Implemented
### 1. Serve files over HTTP during development
Run a lightweight web server from the project root so that CSV requests originate from the same host:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Open the visualizations in a browser at `http://localhost:8000/visualizations/...`.

### 2. Load external CSV data
The treemap HTML files now fetch their data from `../treemaps/enhanced_job_data.csv` using jQuery's `$.get`. This keeps datasets external and easy to update without editing HTML.

### 3. Files Updated
- `visualizations/direct_html_job_treemap.html`
- `visualizations/direct_html_compensation_treemap.html`

## Testing
1. Start the local server as shown above.
2. Navigate to each visualization URL in a browser or headless runner.
3. Confirm that the treemaps render and no CORS errors appear in the console.
